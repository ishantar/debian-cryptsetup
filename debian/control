Description: configures encrypted block devices
 Cryptsetup provides a command-line interface for configuring encrypted
 devices. This is done using the Linux kernel device mapper target
 dm-crypt. This version of cryptsetup has integrated support for LUKS.
 .
 cryptsetup is backwards compatible with the on-disk format of cryptoloop,
 but also supports more secure formats. This package includes support for
 automatically configuring encrypted devices at boot time via the config
 file /etc/crypttab. Additional features are cryptoroot support through
 initramfs-tools and several supported ways to read a passphrase or key.
