cryptsetup (2:1.0.4+svn16-1) unstable; urgency=high

  The --key-file=- argument has changed. If a --hash parameter is passed, it
  will now be honored. This means that the decrypt_derived keyscript will in
  some situations create a different key than previously meaning that any swap
  partitions that rely on the script will have to be recreated. To emulate the
  old behaviour, make sure that you pass "--hash=plain" to cryptsetup.

cryptsetup (2:1.0.4-7) unstable; urgency=low

  The cryptsetup initramfs scripts now also tries to detect swap
  partitions used for software suspend (swsusp/suspend2/uswsusp) and
  to set them up during the initramfs stage. See README.initramfs for
  more details.

cryptsetup (2:1.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

   The ssl and gpg options in /etc/crypttab have been deprecated in
   favour of the keyscripts option. The options will still work, but
   generate warnings. You should change any lines containing these
   options to use keyscript=/lib/cryptsetup/scripts/decrypt_old_ssl or
   keyscript=/lib/cryptsetup/scripts/decrypt_gpg instead as support
   will be completely removed in the future.

cryptsetup (2:1.0.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

   Up to now, the us keymap was loaded at the passphrase prompt in the boot
   process and ascii characters were always used. With this upload this is
   fixed, meaning that the correct keymap is loaded and the keyboard is
   (optionally) set to UTF8 mode before the passphrase prompt.

   This may result in your password not working any more in the boot process.
   In this case, you should add a new key with cryptsetup luksAddKey with your
   correct keymap loaded.

   Additionally, all four fields are now mandatory in /etc/crypttab. An entry
   which does not contain all fields will be ignored. It is recommented to
   set cipher, size and hash anyway, as defaults may change in the future.

   If you didn't set any of these settings yet, then you should add
       cipher=aes-cbc-plain,size=128,hash=ripemd160
   to the the options in /etc/crypttab. See man crypttab(5) for more details.

cryptsetup (2:1.0.2+1.0.3-rc2-2) unstable; urgency=low

   The crypttab 'retry' has been renamed to 'tries' to reflect upstreams
   functionality. Default is 3 tries now, even if the option is not given.
   See the crypttab.5 manpage for more information.

cryptsetup (2:1.0.2+1.0.3-rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Since release 2:1.0.1-9, the cryptsetup package uses cryptsetup-luks as
    upstream source. This is a enhanced version of plain cryptsetup which
    includes support for the LUKS extension, a standard on-disk format for
    hard disk encryption. Plain dm-crypt (as provided by the old cryptsetup
    package) is still available, thus backwards compatibility is given.
    Nevertheless it is recommended to update your encrypted partitions to
    LUKS, as this implementation is more secure than the plain dm-crypt.

    Another major change is the check option for crypttab. It allows to
    configure checks that are run after cryptsetup has been invoked, and
    prechecks to be run against the source device before cryptsetup has been
    invoked. See man crypttab(5) or README.Debian for more information.
