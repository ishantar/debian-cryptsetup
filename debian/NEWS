cryptsetup (2:1.0.2+1.0.3-rc2-2) unstable; urgency=low

   The crypttab 'retry' has been renamed to 'tries' to reflect upstreams
   functionality. Default is 3 tries now, even if the option is not given.
   See the crypttab.5 manpage for more information.

cryptsetup (2:1.0.2+1.0.3-rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Since release 2:1.0.1-9, the cryptsetup package uses cryptsetup-luks as
    upstream source. This is a enhanced version of plain cryptsetup which
    includes support for the LUKS extension, a standard on-disk format for
    hard disk encryption. Plain dm-crypt (as provided by the old cryptsetup
    package) is still available, thus backwards compatibility is given.
    Nevertheless it is recommended to update your encrypted partitions to
    LUKS, as this implementation is more secure than the plain dm-crypt.

    Another major change is the check option for crypttab. It allows to
    configure checks that are run after cryptsetup has been invoked, and
    prechecks to be run against the source device before cryptsetup has been
    invoked. See man crypttab(5) or README.Debian for more information.
