cryptsetup (2:1.0.1-17) unstable; urgency=low

    Since release 2:1.0.1-9, the cryptsetup package uses cryptsetup-luks as
    upstream source. This is a enhanced version of plain cryptsetup which
    includes support for the LUKS extension, a standard on-disk format for
    hard disk encryption. Plain dm-crypt (as provided by the old cryptsetup
    package) is still available, thus backwards compability is given.
    Nevertheless it is recomented to update your encrypted partitions to
    LUKS, as this implementation is more secure than the plain dm-crypt.
