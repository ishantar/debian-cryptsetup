cryptsetup (2:1.0.6~pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jonas Meurer ]
  * New upstream alpha release 1.0.6~pre1:
    - [01_crypt_luksFormat_libcryptsetup.dpatch] removed, applied upstream
    - [02_manpage.dpatch] likewise
    - [04_fix_unused_or_unitialized_variables.dpatch] likewise
    - [05_segfault_at_nonexisting_device.dpatch] likewise
    - [06_run_udevsettle.dpatch] update for new upstream
  * Disable 03_check_for_root.dpatch. As Ludwig Nussel mentioned on
    dm-crypt@saout.de, cryptsetup 1.0.5 already prints out meaningfull errors
    if expected permissions are not available. Therefore the check for uid ==
    0 is superfluous.
  * [06_run_udevsettle.dpatch] Run udevsettle after device-mapper device
    creation. Fixes issues with temporary device files in /dev/mapper. Patch
    by Reinhard Tartler from Ubuntu. (closes: #444914)
  * Add support for offset and skip options to cryptdisks/crypttab. Thanks to
    Marc-Jano Knopp. (closes: #446674)
  * Update the long description in debian/control. Don't mention kernel 2.6.4
    any longer, remove references to /usr/share/doc/cryptsetup/CryptoRoot.HowTo
    and mkinitrd.
  * Add noearly option to cryptdisks/crypttab, which causes cryptdisks-early
    to ignore the entry. Thanks to Joerg Jaspert (closes: #423102)
  * Change log_progress_msg "$dst (started)" to device_msg "$dst" "started" in
    cryptdisks.functions. Makes console output of cryptdisks more consistent.
  * Add cryptdisks_start and patch to cryptdisks.functions by Jon Dowland.
    Also add a manpage for cryptdisks_start(8). (closes: #447159)
  * Add load_optimized_module() function to cryptdisks.functions. Initial idea
    by Reinhard Tartler from Ubuntu, enhanced by David Härdeman.
    (closes: #445186)
  * Add support for UUID=.. device strings to initramfs cryptroot-hook. Thanks
    to Reinhard Tartler from Ubuntu for the patch. (closes: #445189)
  * Support UUID=... and LABEL=... device strings in /etc/crypttab. Thanks
    to Martin Pitt from Ubuntu for the patch. (closes: #445189)
  * Add Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Svn fields to debian/control.
  * Fix debian/rules to not fail to build if autom4te.cache is left behind
    from a previous incomplete build. Patch again taken from Ubuntu.
  * Mention in the crypttab manpage that files are allowed as source. In that
    case they are mounted as loopback device automatically. Thanks to
    Michal Cihar (closes: #451909)
  * At stopping dm-crypt devices really remove the corresponding loopback
    device if one has been used. Thanks to Rene Pavlik for report and to David
    Härdeman, who had the idea for the fix.  (closes: #451916)
  * Also remove loopback devices if the cryptsetup device setup fails.
  * Document a possible deadlock if cryptsetup is invoked as a 'run programm'
    in a udev role. This i related to the invokation of udevsettle in
    cryptsetup. Thanks to Dick Middleton for reporting and debugging.
    (closes: #444914)
  * Move umount_fs() from handle_crypttab_line() to the end of do_start().
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3.0. No changes needed.
  * Remove unused litian-override file
  * Remove --build $(DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE) and --host $(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE) from
    invocation of ./configure, as they are already included in $(confflags).

    - add some hyphen fixes to patches/02_manpage.dpatch
  * Filter out the detection of filesystem type 'minix' in checks vol_id and
    un_vol_id if checking for any valid filesystem. The minix fs signature
    seems short enough to be detected erroneously by /lib/udev/vol_id.

    keyfiles from removable media. see the crypttab.5 manpage for more
    information.
  * use upstream cryptsetup tries option instead of the shell code in
    cryptdisks. rename cryptdisks 'retry' option to 'tries'.
  * document the fact, that the default settings in /etc/default/cryptdisks
    take only effect if the relevant option is set without a value in
    crypttab. add the environment section to crypttab.5.txt (closes: #364203)
  * update the TODO list.
  * update crypdisks.default
  * run do_swap and do_tmp. Thanks to Riku Voipio <riku.voipio@iki.fi>
    (closes: #365633)
  * bump Standards-Version to 3.7.2.0, no changes needed

  [ David Härdeman ]
  * add lvm capabilities to initramfs scripts (closes: #362564)
  * add cryptsetup.postinst which executes update-initramfs when 
    cryptsetup is first installed (not on upgrades)

cryptsetup (2:1.0.2+1.0.3-rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jonas Meurer ]
  * new upstream version 1.0.3-rc2, fixing issues with devmapper
  * new upstream version 1.0.3-rc1, doesn't use essiv per default
  * new upstream version (1.0.2) released
    - add --timeout option for interactive usage
    - add --batch-mode option to suppress input verifications
  * install local cryptsetup.8 copy instead of the upstream manpage
    - mention --readonly as possible option to luksOpen (closes: #353753)
    - mention --batch-mode, --timeout, --version
    - transform remaining option hyphens from '-' to '\-'
  * merged ubuntu patches:
    - modify cryptdisks init script to use lsb functions
    - add luksformat and a manpage
  * removed postinst and postrm, empty scripts
  * added a README.Debian and a TODO
  * added a NEWS file for Debian, and explain both the upstream transition
    from plain cryptsetup to cryptsetup-luks, and the check options for
    crypttab.
  * install manpages using dh_installman, not with install
  * updated CryptoRoot.HowTo, mention /etc/mkinitrd/modules and different
    linux-image versions. (closes: #344867)
  * removed needless debian/hack
  * added debian/watch
  * bumped debhelper compat level to 5, add versioned depends on
    debhelper (>> 5.0.0)
  * update debian/cryptsetup.8 to mention batch-mode and timeout
  * updated cryptdisks
    - modify init script to use lsb functions, at least where possible
    - updated comments for cryptdisks.default
    - moved option parsing and setup of loopback devices to seperate functions.
      added a new include file /lib/cryptsetup/init_functions with functions
      parse_opts, lo_setup, check_key, do_luks, do_noluks, do_swap, do_tmp
    - always check for the source device exists before running cryptsetup
    - hardcode precheck for LUKS to use 'cryptsetup isLuks'. this is much safer
      than allowing other random prechecks, as it manifests that the source
      device actually is a LUKS partition.
    - don't remove the LUKS device when postcheck fails, as the supplied
      password/key is correct anyway.
    - use the new 'timeout' commandline option of cryptsetup instead of an
      external wrapper
    - be silent for not existing devices per default. Implement the loud
      option for crypttab to warn if a device does not exist.
    - remerge postchecks and prechecks into checks.
    - don't disable swap & luks combination, instead disable luks with
      /dev/random, /dev/urandom or /dev/hwrandom as key.
    - run parse_opts before check_key, to know whether we use luks or not

  [ Michael Gebetsroither ]
  * converted crypttab.sgml to asciidoc
  * added dependencies for asciidoc to manpage conversion
  * added developer documentation for a robust checksystem into cryptdisks

cryptsetup (2:1.0.1-16) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jonas Meurer ]
  * already fixed in 2:1.0.1-14: binaries xor and delay from
    usbcrypto.mkinitrd don't exist in debian. replaces with a perl script
    and /bin/sleep. thanks to wesley terpstra for the help.
    (closes: #324353)
  * clean cryptdisks from bashisms (closes: #350360)
  * check for /usr/bin/timeout before using it in cryptdisks. First, it's
    only available when /usr is mounted, and that is not definitive when
    cryptdisks is run at boot time. Second, timeout is a non-essential
    debian package, and not neccecarily installed. The usage of
    /usr/bin/timeout in any case is only a temporary workaround.
  * move /usr/share/cryptsetup to /lib/cryptsetup, as the checks need to be
    available at boot time, before local filesystems (like i.e. /usr) are
    mounted.
  * replace RETRY=`expr $RETRY - 1` with RETRY=$(($RETRY-1)), as expr is in
    /usr/bin.
  * install init.d script and default file with dh_installinit
    (closes: #350548)
  * don't build-depend on cvs

cryptsetup (2:1.0.1-14) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jonas Meurer ]
  * added a configurable timeout option for interactive password
    prompt. set the default timeout to 180 seconds in
    /etc/default/cryptdisks, and documented the crypttab option in
    the crypttab manpage. (closes: #328961)
  * fixed the default "precheck" and "postcheck" options, currently
    no useful precheck exists, so no default here.
  * removed the dummy cryptsetup-luks package, ftpmaster complains
    about it.

  [ Michael Gebetsroither ]
