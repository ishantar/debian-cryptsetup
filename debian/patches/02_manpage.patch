 .SH NOTES ON SUPPORTED CIPHERS, MODES, HASHES AND KEY SIZES
 The available combinations of ciphers, modes, hashes and key sizes depend on kernel support. See /proc/crypto for a list of available options. You might need to load additional kernel crypto modules in order to get more options.
 
-For --hash option all algorithms supported by gcrypt library are available.
+For \-\-hash option all algorithms supported by gcrypt library are available.
 .SH NOTES ON PASSWORDS
 Mathematics can't be bribed. Make sure you keep your passwords safe. There are a few nice tricks for constructing a fallback, when suddenly out of (or after being) blue, your brain refuses to cooperate. These fallbacks are possible with LUKS, as it's only possible with LUKS to have multiple passwords.
