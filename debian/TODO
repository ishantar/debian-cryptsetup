TODO-list for cryptsetup in Debian
----------------------------------
* provide support for LVM on encryped devices
  - run cryptdisks twice in boot process: once before lvm/raid is started,
    and once after that
* split cryptdisks in a main script and an include file
* improve the checks, see CheckSystem.Doc for more information
