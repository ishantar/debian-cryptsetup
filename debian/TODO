TODO-list for cryptsetup in Debian
----------------------------------
* provide support for LVM on encryped devices
  - check for existance of source device before running cryptsetup
  - run cryptdisks twice in boot process: once before lvm/raid is started,
    and once after that
* improve the checks
  - distinguish between luks, plain cryptsetup and swap
   swap:
     + precheck for any existing filesystem, fail if possitive
     + postcheck for nothing, just go ahead with mkswap, swapon
   plain cryptsetup:
     + precheck for any existing filesystem, fail if possitive
     + postcheck for the expected filesystem, fail if negative
   luks cryptsetup:
     + precheck for a valid luks partition, fail if negative
     + postcheck for the expected filesystem, fail if negative
