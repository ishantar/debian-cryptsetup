Post-Lenny:

- discuss with upstream how stable the library abi is (#480157)

- would a fallback make sense? like when using any keyscript, try passphrase
  in the case that it fails. if we implement that at all, never make it the
  default, and warn about security issues in README.Debian. even explain that
  backup passphrase keyslots thwart the extra security of keyfiles/keyscripts.
  (#438481, #471729)

- implement something like 'ignore-if-no-device' to mount (/etc/fstab), and
  thus support several situations where cryptsetup fails to setup a device:
  -> the device is not attached at all
  -> wrong passphrase/no keyfile available
  -> timeouts arise
  (#474120)

- reimplement timeout support in a cleaner way?
